    <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
    <div class="content-container">
      <p>Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. This includes used electronics that are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal. The rapid pace of technological advancement and shortened device lifecycles have led to an alarming increase in e-waste globally.</p>
      <p>Common examples of e-waste include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Computers and laptops</li>
        <li>Smartphones and tablets</li>
        <li>Televisions and monitors</li>
        <li>Printers and scanners</li>
        <li>Household appliances</li>
        <li>Entertainment devices</li>

    <h2>History of E-Waste</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>1970s-1980s</h3>
        <p>The birth of personal computing and consumer electronics began creating the first wave of electronic waste as early devices became obsolete.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>1990s</h3>
        <p>Rapid technological advancement accelerated e-waste generation. The first e-waste recycling initiatives emerged as environmental concerns grew.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2000s</h3>
        <p>Global awareness increased with the implementation of the Basel Convention restricting hazardous waste movement across borders. The EU introduced the WEEE Directive in 2003.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2010s-Present</h3>
        <p>E-waste became the fastest-growing waste stream globally. More comprehensive legislation and corporate responsibility programs developed alongside recycling technologies.</p>

    <h2>Issues in E-Waste Management</h2>
    <div class="card-container">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Hazardous Materials</h3>
        <p>E-waste contains toxic substances like lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants that can leach into soil and water when improperly disposed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Informal Recycling</h3>
        <p>Unregulated e-waste processing in developing countries exposes workers to dangerous conditions and toxic substances without proper safety equipment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Resource Depletion</h3>
        <p>Valuable materials like gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements are lost when e-waste is not properly recycled.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Global Inequity</h3>
        <p>Developed nations often export e-waste to developing countries, creating environmental justice concerns and uneven distribution of hazards.</p>
